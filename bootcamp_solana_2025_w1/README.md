# Bootcamp Solana 2025 - Week 1 Rust Exercises

This project contains Rust programming exercises for Week 1 of the Solana Bootcamp 2025.

## Project Structure

This Rust project includes two main examples:

1. **FizzBuzz**  
   - Prints numbers from 1 to 300.
   - Replaces numbers divisible by 3 with "fizz", by 5 with "buzz", and both with "fizz buzz".
   - Counts how many times "fizz buzz" appears.

2. **Two Sum**  
   - Given a list of numbers and a target number, finds two numbers in the list that add up to the target.
   - Returns their positions (indices).
   - Example:  
     Input: `[2, 7, 11, 15]`, Target: `9` ? Output: `[0, 1]`
